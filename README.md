I've spent nights wrestling with code, solving over a thousand problems, learning the art of breaking things down and shaping them back better. My Codeforces journey isn't glorious (yet), but it's honest, [here's the trail](https://codeforces.com/profile/_flood). Highest rating: 1259. Just a pupil, but always sharpening the blade.

Design fascinates me, not the pretty colors and fancy animations, but the invisible stuff. How information moves, why users click what they click, how systems talk to each other without breaking.

Currently figuring out what's next while making sure whatever I touch gets a little better than when I found it.
